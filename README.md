Podcastfy is an open-source Python package that transforms multi-modal content (text, images) into engaging, multi-lingual audio conversations using GenAI. Input content includes websites, PDFs, images, YouTube videos, as well as user provided topics.

Unlike closed-source UI-based tools focused primarily on research synthesis (e.g. NotebookLM ‚ù§Ô∏è), Podcastfy focuses on open source, programmatic and bespoke generation of engaging, conversational content from a multitude of multi-modal sources, enabling customization and scale.

## Testimonials üí¨

> "Love that you casually built an open source version of the most popular product Google built in the last decade"

## Example Use Cases üéßüé∂

- **Content Creators** can use `Podcastfy` to convert blog posts, articles, or multimedia content into podcast-style audio, enabling them to reach broader audiences. By transforming content into an audio format, creators can cater to users who prefer listening over reading.

- **Educators** can transform lecture notes, presentations, and visual materials into audio conversations, making educational content more accessible to students with different learning preferences. This is particularly beneficial for students with visual impairments or those who have difficulty processing written information.

- **Researchers** can convert research papers, visual data, and technical content into conversational audio. This makes it easier for a wider audience, including those with disabilities, to consume and understand complex scientific information. Researchers can also create audio summaries of their work to enhance accessibility.

- **Accessibility Advocates** can use `Podcastfy` to promote digital accessibility by providing a tool that converts multimodal content into auditory formats. This helps individuals with visual impairments, dyslexia, or other disabilities that make it challenging to consume written or visual content.
